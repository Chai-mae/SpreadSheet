Spreadsheets are computer applications used to store, analyze, organize and manipulate data in the rows and columns of a grid. The program operates by taking in data, which can be numbers or text, into the cells of tables.  If the data is numbers, the program will compute it for you depending on the function you need to be completed.

A spreadsheet is an easy way to store all different kinds of data. These data types can include financial data, customer data and product data. Excel spreadsheets can support more than a million rows and more than 16,000 columns, so you’ll have plenty of space to store a huge amount. That’s what makes them ideal for database creation.
