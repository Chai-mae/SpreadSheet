**<h2>Introduction</h2>**

Spreadsheets are computer applications used to store, analyze, organize and manipulate data in the rows and columns of a grid. The program operates by taking in data, which can be numbers or text, into the cells of tables.  If the data is numbers, the program will compute it for you depending on the function you need to be completed.
